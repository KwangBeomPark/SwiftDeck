## What SwiftDeck Does

**SwiftDeck** helps office professionals eliminate repetitive work by combining folder shortcuts, text automation, prompt execution, hotstrings, key remapping, and a quick prompt popup menu into one lightweight Windows tray application.

It is designed especially for finance, sales administration, accounting, credit control, and other back-office teams that repeatedly work with ERP systems, monthly closing folders, shared drives, standard emails, and routine operational text.

> **Accelerate Team Month-End Closings · Prevent Human Errors · Reduce Repetitive Tasks · Standardize Workflows**

## Core Features

- **📂 1-Click Folder Navigation**: Open frequently used folders, ERP download paths, monthly evidence folders, and shared network drives from a hotkey menu. Supports subfolder browsing up to 2 levels deep with an intelligent cache.
- **⌨️ Prompt & SQL Text Automation**: Run long text blocks, SQL queries, AI prompts, or control-key sequences such as `{Enter}`, `{Tab}`, `{Wait:500}`, and `Ctrl+S`.
- **📋 Quick Prompt Popup Menu**: Press `Shift + Win + Space` to instantly display all registered prompts in a popup menu at your mouse cursor position — no need to remember individual slot numbers.
- **✏️ Hotstrings**: Expand short abbreviations into full email templates, reporting phrases, symbols, or standard messages instantly after a space or Enter key.
- **🔀 Key Remapping**: Remap rarely used keys such as CapsLock into practical shortcuts, mouse clicks, or workflow-specific actions.
- **⚙️ Portable Team Deployment**: Share local `.ini` settings files to standardize folder paths, prompts, and templates across a team with zero installation.

## 🚀 Download & Quick Start

**SwiftDeck** is a **portable application**. It runs by double-clicking the executable and does not require installation.

### 📥 For General Users (1-Click Portable Download)

1. Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/KwangBeomPark/02_SwiftDeck/releases)** tab on the right side of the GitHub repository.
2. Download the latest **`SwiftDeck.zip`** or standalone **`SwiftDeck.exe`** file.
3. Unzip the file if needed, then double-click **`SwiftDeck.exe`**.
4. A black lightning bolt icon will appear in the Windows system tray — SwiftDeck is ready to use.

If no release file is available yet, please build or run `src/SwiftDeck.ahk` using AutoHotkey v2.

### 🔄 Automatic Updates

SwiftDeck checks the latest public GitHub Release after startup at most once every 24 hours. Open **App Information** or choose **Check for Updates** from the tray menu to refresh manually. When a newer verified release is available, **Update & Restart** downloads `SwiftDeck.exe` beside the currently running app, verifies its SHA-256 digest, safely replaces the executable, and restarts SwiftDeck. Saved settings in `%AppData%\SwiftDeck` are not replaced. Source mode and read-only folders remain manual-update only.

### 🛠️ For Power Users & Developers (Custom Build)

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Customize `src/SwiftDeck.ahk` as needed.
4. Use the Ahk2Exe tool included with AutoHotkey to package your own `SwiftDeck.exe` into `dist/`.

### Repository Layout

```text
src/      Source entry point and AutoHotkey library files
assets/   Public images, icons, and README media
dist/     Local release artifacts such as .exe and .zip files, excluded from Git
```

Release binaries should be uploaded to GitHub Releases, not committed to the repository body.

## 💼 Practical FinOps & Business Use Cases

- **Month-end closing folder access**: Press `F1` to open a menu of monthly closing folders, ERP downloads, evidence files, and shared drives — all within one click.
- **SQL / AI prompt execution**: Press a registered shortcut or open the Quick Prompt Menu (`Shift + Win + Space`) to type any stored AI prompt or SQL query automatically.
- **Standard email templates**: Type a short hotstring such as `;t1` to expand it instantly into a full report message, budget request, or daily cash update.
- **Quick Prompt Popup**: Browse and launch all prompts slot-by-slot from a popup menu at your mouse cursor — ideal for users managing multiple AI prompt libraries.
- **Fatigue reduction**: Remap repetitive keyboard or mouse operations to reduce wrist strain during long Excel, ERP, or copy-paste work sessions.
- **Team standardization**: A manager can configure common prompts, folder paths, and hotstrings once, then distribute the generated `.ini` files to bring the whole team onto the same workflow standard.

## ⌨️ Essential Shortcuts & Controls

| Shortcut | Function |
|---------|----------|
| `F1` (Default) | Open the Favorite Folders popup menu from anywhere |
| `Win + Numpad (0~9)` | Execute registered prompt slots directly by number |
| `Shift + Win + Space` | Open the **Quick Prompt Popup Menu** at mouse position |
| `Ctrl + Win + Space` | Open the emoji and symbol picker |
| `Ctrl + F1` (Default) | Add the current Explorer folder to Favorites. If the Favorites hotkey changes, SwiftDeck derives and displays a non-conflicting related shortcut. |
| `;abbreviation` e.g. `;t1` | Expand a hotstring into long text or an email template |
| `System Tray Menu` | Open App Settings and related management menus |

## ⚙️ Settings File & Team Deployment

SwiftDeck stores all configuration data in local `.ini` files — no registry entries, no hidden data.

You can open the settings folder from:

```text
System Tray Menu → Open Settings Folder
```

The same actions are available in **App Settings → General → Data, Startup & Recovery**:

- **Open Folder** opens the local settings directory.
- **Backup Saved** backs up the last saved configuration. Click **Save & Apply** first if the dashboard shows unsaved changes.
- **Restore** confirms before replacing the current configuration and then reloads SwiftDeck.
- **Factory Reset** preserves backups but replaces active settings with defaults after confirmation.

For team deployment, one manager can configure common folder paths, prompts, and hotstrings first, then share the generated `.ini` files with colleagues. Each team member simply places the files in the correct location and reloads the app — no additional setup required.

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- SwiftDeck runs locally on Windows. Settings are stored on the user's machine and are not synced by the app.
- When the built-in translation feature is used, the selected text is sent to Google's public translation endpoint for that request.
- If bundled support images are missing, the app may download public UI assets such as the Buy Me a Coffee button or GitHub favicon.
- All folder paths, prompts, hotstrings, and key remap settings are stored in local `.ini` files only.
- **Shell injection protection**: Folder paths are validated before execution — characters such as `&`, `|`, `>`, and `<` that could chain OS commands are blocked automatically.
- Avoid storing passwords, API keys, personal credentials, or highly confidential information in Prompt or Hotstring settings.
- Review shared `.ini` files carefully before distributing them to other users.

## 👨‍💼 Project Background

I am **not a professional software developer, but a business operations practitioner who wanted to reduce repetitive office workflows.**

Watching daily repetitive tasks such as complex ERP inquiries, scattered month-end folder searches, and routine email drafting consume valuable team hours, I started this project with a practical question: **How can we remove inefficient workflows and help the whole team focus on higher-value work?**

By analyzing real operational pain points and bottlenecks, **SwiftDeck** evolved from a personal macro script into a practical, enterprise-grade office automation suite for standardizing workflows and elevating team productivity.

## 💻 Environment & License

- **Environment**: Windows 10 / 11, AutoHotkey v2 runtime, or compiled standalone executable
- **License**: MIT License. SwiftDeck is open-source and free to modify and distribute.
